What's it do?
---------------------
*Firebased was designed to be a starting point for any AngularFire (AngularJS+Firebase) web application. Here are a few feature highlights...*

- Account handling (includes cookie session storage)
- [Dead simple three way data binding](https://www.firebase.com/blog/2013-10-04-firebase-angular-data-binding.html) on user-specific arrays. *(Confused? Open 2 demo pages simultaneously and modify some text)*
- A functional and responsive bootstrap template
- Implements a wide range of Angular, Firebase, and MVC concepts out of the box.

Depends on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), [angularfire](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/), and [angular-cookie](https://github.com/ivpusic/angular-cookie)

How do I get started?
---------------------
*To get started, simply change "appName" at the top of app.js to your [firebase](https://www.firebase.com) appName and run index.html. Currently, all logic is contained in the controllers found in app.js*

- Please note that this is a beta version of which is still under developmet. Any and all contributions are greatly appreciated!

*Documentation coming soon!*
