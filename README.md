Firebased
==============
*Start your AngularFire one page app off with a bang. Firebased is a unique AngularFire SPA template to help kick start your development.*
To get started, simply change "appname" at the top of app.js to your firebase data URL and run index.html. Currently, all logic is contained in the controllers found in app.js


What's it do?
---------------------
*Firebased was designed to be a starting point for any AngularFire single page application. Here are a few feature highlights...*
-Account Handling (includes cookie session storage)
-Three Way Data Binding on user-specific arrays (Confused? Open 2 demo pages simultaneously and modify some text)
-Implements a wide range of Angular, Firebase, and MVC concepts out of the box.

Depends on Bootstrap, jQuery, firebase, angularfire, and angular-cookie.
Any and all contributions are greatly appreciated!
